# Credit Risk Analysis – Explainable Credit Scoring

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a credit risk scoring model to predict loan default using real-world client data.  
The objective is not only to achieve good predictive performance, but also to ensure interpretability and transparency, which are critical requirements in credit risk management.

The project explores the trade-off between model performance and explainability, comparing traditional and more advanced machine learning approaches, and demonstrates how modern interpretable models can bridge this gap.

## Objectives

- Estimate the probability of default (PD) for individual loan applicants
- Identify high-risk clients to support credit decision-making
- Provide clear explanations for individual risk assessments
- Enable the definition of risk-based decision thresholds

## Problem Framing

- **Task:** Binary classification (Default / No Default)
- **Context:** Credit risk scoring
- **Challenge:** Class imbalance and the need for explainable decisions
- **Key constraint:** Models must be auditable and defensible, not only accurate

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on loan applicants, including:

- Demographics (e.g. Age)
- Financial variables (Income, LoanAmount, InterestRate, DTI)
- Employment characteristics
- Credit-related indicators

The target variable is **Default**, indicating whether the client defaulted on the loan.

The observed default rate is approximately **11.6%**, which is typical for credit risk problems and motivates the use of appropriate evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory analysis focused on understanding:

- The distribution and imbalance of the target variable
- Differences in key variables between defaulting and non-defaulting clients

### Key Findings

- Clients who default tend to have lower income on average, though with significant overlap
- CreditScore and DTI show meaningful but non-deterministic differences across groups
- Employment type is strongly associated with default rates, with unemployed and part-time workers exhibiting higher risk

These results confirm that no single variable explains default on its own, reinforcing the need for multivariate modeling.

## Data Preparation

- Separation of numerical and categorical variables
- One-hot encoding applied to categorical variables (fit on training data only to avoid leakage)
- Sparse matrix representation due to high dimensionality
- Stratified train/test split to preserve default rates

## Modeling Approach

### Baseline Model – Logistic Regression

A logistic regression model was trained as a baseline:

- **ROC-AUC:** ~0.74
- Prioritizes recall for the default class
- Provides a transparent reference point for comparison

### Advanced Model – HistGradientBoosting

A `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` was trained to improve performance:

- **ROC-AUC:** ~0.76
- Fewer false positives, but lower recall for defaults
- Illustrates the trade-off between precision and risk detection

### Interpretable Model – Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)

As the final step, an **Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)** was implemented to combine performance and interpretability.

Due to the high dimensionality generated by one-hot encoding, a feature selection step based on minimum frequency was applied, reducing the feature space to **24 variables** while preserving explanatory power.

- **ROC-AUC:** 0.7566
- Fully interpretable at both global and individual levels
- Each prediction can be decomposed into feature-level contributions

EBM enables understanding not only the probability of default, but also *why* a given client is considered risky, making it suitable for real-world credit decision processes.

## Individual Client Explanation

For a selected high-risk client, the model estimates a **probability of default of 79.55%**.

### Main Drivers of Risk

- **Income** and **Age**, which explain most of the decision impact
- **LoanAmount** and employment-related variables further increase risk
- Some factors provide minor risk mitigation, but are insufficient to offset the main drivers

This type of explanation enables:

- Justification of credit decisions
- Manual review workflows
- Transparent communication and auditability
